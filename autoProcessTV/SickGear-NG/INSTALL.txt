SickGear Process Media extension for NZBGet
===========================================

If NZBGet v17+ is installed on the same system as SickGear then as a local install,

1) Add the location of this script file to NZBGet Settings/PATHS/ScriptDir

2) Navigate to any named TV category at Settings/Categories, click "Choose" Category.Extensions then Apply SickGear-NG

This is the best set up to automatically get script updates from SickGear
